<p id="description">This project implements a recursive web crawler that estimates the number of links on a specified domain and retrieves those links efficiently. Leveraging Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries it traverses web pages to gather link data up to a specified depth. The tool features a spinner animation to enhance user experience during link estimation and integrates a progress bar to visualize the crawling process. Ideal for web scraping enthusiasts and developers looking to analyze web structures or build data aggregation tools.</p>
